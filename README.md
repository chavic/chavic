## Hi thereðŸ‘‹

I write:sparkles:**code**:sparkles:.

***WhaaÃ a! What kind of code you ask?***.

Well I can write Kotlin/Java, Dart, 
JavaScript/NodeJs, C# and python.

I taught myself everything I know about computers 
and how to code. 
I actually know more programing languages but those are the ones I used 
in my projects. Technically typescript isn't a
language but I use it all the time.
