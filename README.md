## Hello there👋

I use various tools and programming languages to build mobile, desktop, and server-side software.
I love to explore different technologies and find the best solutions for my projects, whether building full-stack software, data science projects, or embedded systems projects.

Currently part of BitDevs Zambia, and contributing to projects in the Bitcoin Ecosystem
