### ~/whoami

I like hard problems with real users on the other side.

Most of my work sits where **Rust back-ends**, **cross-language FFI**, and **Bitcoin or decision systems** intersect.  
I care about code that can be read in one sitting, debugged at 3 AM, and still makes sense two years later.

Currently: Part of BitDevs Zambia, and contributing to projects in the Bitcoin Ecosystem, shipping Bitcoin tooling, UniFFI-Dart, and AI, and exploring decision systems.

Based in Lusaka, Zambia. BitDevs Zambia member.


### ~/stack

- **Back-end** – Rust, Postgres, Redis, gRPC/REST.
- **Bitcoin** – BDK, Payjoin, wallet flows, descriptor-based design.
- **FFI & runtimes** – UniFFI, Rust → Dart/JS bindings, CI pipelines.
- **AI & data** – Python/Julia/C#/Rust for analytics, models, and decision systems.
- **Front-end** – Flutter, React/Next.js, Tauri.
